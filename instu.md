# ðŸ“± Mobile Optimization Prompt for Cursor

You are optimizing the **Veltra Automations** website for **all mobile breakpoints (â‰¤1024px, â‰¤768px, â‰¤480px)**.  
Do not rewrite desktop code â€” only apply **responsive overrides**.  
Preserve the **premium, futuristic, trustworthy feel** of the site.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Ensure all sections (Nav, Hero, Products, About, FAQ, Contact, Modal) look **flawless on mobile**.  
- No clipped text, broken grids, or hidden CTAs.  
- CTAs must remain **tap-friendly (â‰¥44px height)**.  
- Animations and background morphing must scale smoothly on smaller screens.

## ðŸ”‘ Responsive Adjustments

### 1. Navigation Bar & Overlay
- **â‰¤1024px**: Hide desktop `.nav-links`, show `.mobile-menu-btn`.  
- Full-screen mobile overlay: **dark gradient + blur**, vertical stacked links with `52px` spacing.  
- **CTA button**: large, full-width, **fixed at bottom** inside overlay.  

### 2. Hero Section
- **Video background**: `object-fit: cover`, auto-center crop.  
- Reduce **hook text size** by ~20%.  
- Keep hero CTAs stacked **vertically with 16px gap**, buttons expand full width.  
- Maintain **fade-in reveal** after delay, even on reload.  

### 3. Products Section
- **â‰¤1024px**: Grid â†’ 2 columns.  
- **â‰¤768px**: Grid â†’ single column, card padding reduced (24px â†’ 20px).  
- **â‰¤480px**: Headings scale down (`2rem` max), CTAs shrink padding.  

### 4. About Section
- **â‰¤768px**: Collapse grid â†’ single column, text center-aligned.  
- **Counters**: Stack vertically with `32px` gap.  
- Titles and paragraphs scale with `clamp()` for readability.  

### 5. FAQ Section
- Accordion must remain **full-width** with padding reduced to `20px`.  
- Questions remain **one-line on small screens**, icons aligned right.  

### 6. Contact Section
- **â‰¤768px**: Contact grid â†’ single column.  
- Emails and phone numbers remain tappable (no zoom).  
- Founder cards stack vertically with `24px` spacing.  

### 7. Book a Demo Modal
- On mobile:  
  - **Max height 85vh**, scrollable inside modal.  
  - Form inputs stacked, dropdowns span full width.  
  - Phone/time groups collapse to vertical layout.  
  - Submit button full width.  

### 8. Orb & Background Morph System
- On mobile:  
  - Reduce orb size (5px â†’ 3.5px).  
  - Limit to 25 orbs per section.  
  - Maintain smooth scroll morph without lag.

## âœ… Expected Mobile UX
